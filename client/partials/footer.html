			<p>"Climate Canary" connects climate justice with food security. Cages of threatened foodstuff from around the world, like canaries in a coal mine, signal the present and unfolding dangers of global warming while bird songs fill the air. With an elevation of no more than five meters above sea level, Tuvalu is predicted to be the first country to go under water, and as one of the worldâ€™s smallest carbon emitters, its survival depends on transcultural cooperation. "Climate Canary" transcends the priorities of "national" pavilions to insist that ecological activism will succeed when it is as interconnected as globalism itself.</p>
