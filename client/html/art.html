			<p>In the vast Pacific lie some of the smallest inhabited lands, mere dots on the world map. Tuvalu, located south of Hawaii and north of Fiji, occupies nine of these islands (three reef islands and six atolls). No ground on Tuvalu stands more than five meters above sea level. According to the United Nations-sponsored International Panel on Climate Change, this country will be the first to be submerged as sea level rises due to global warming. Tuvalu is the world’s smallest economy to have a national pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale. Titled “Climate Canary,” the multimedia installation by the artist Vincent J. F. Huang connects climate justice and global food security.</p>
			<p>Huang, an eco-artist from Taiwan, is representing Tuvalu at the Biennale for the third time. His 2017 installation incorporates sight, sound, and conceptual elements to call attention to the interconnectedness of the world’s environment crises. In the old days, coal miners brought a caged canary to their pits as canaries are particularly sensitive to methane gas and carbon monoxide. If the canary died, the miners knew they must get out. While the sound of canaries singing is audible in the exhibition space, the birds are replaced by an assortment of endangered crops such as Tuvalu’s swamp taro—the pulaka. Bird cages housing threatened, multi-colored foodstuff from around the globe signal the present and unfolding cost of human-induced climate change. These disappearing crops are our warning. The pulaka, placed in the center cage, is shown in a simulated process of decay.</p>
			<p>This pavilion provokes dialogues art environment crises across regions. Tuvalu has pledged conversion to green energy, but as one of the world’s smallest carbon emitters, Tuvalu’s survival depends on transcultural cooperation. The roughly 11,000 Tuvaluans face the real possibility of being dispossessed of their land and their culture. A re-configured map of the world projected on a main wall shows Tuvalu and other small or impoverished countries magnified in relation to the threats to their very survival. This pavilion transcends the conventional idea of a “national” pavilion, emphasizing that when it comes to ecological activism, all humans belong to a non-exclusive community.</p>
			<p>Responding to the Biennale’s theme “Viva Arte Viva,” the Tuvalu Pavilion will serve as the physical heart of a worldwide “social sculpture,” to echo Joseph Beuys’ idea. An online program will be realized in collaboration with curator, Aida Yuen Wong, to complement the pavilion and to promote ecological art activism beyond the walls of the Arsenale and the dates of the Biennale. Only with world-wide recognition and support would Tuvalu and those poor nations whose fate it shares have a voice at the world’s oldest international art exhibition.</p>
