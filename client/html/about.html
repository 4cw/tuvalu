			<p>Since Charles Keeling began to study atmospheric carbon at Mauna Loa in the 1950s, there has been significant scientific consensus as to the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As of recent years, consensus in both the scientific and      political spheres has been furthered to establish that the accumulation of carbon dioxide is the result of human activity. As  humans continue to produce waste and emit greenhouse gases, they collect in the atmosphere and affect earth's processes.</p>
			<p>A serious issue resulting from the accumulation of CO2 is the rise of sea levels due to heat expansion. Global warming in certain parts of the world's oceans have made the water's average temperature rise. When the water gets warmer, it expands, thus increasing the mass of the ocean. As the sea encroaches on the shore, property is destroyed and soil becomes flooded with salt, making it unproductive for agriculture. These effects are magnified on small islands, and the threat is massive for small islands in the South Pacific such as Tuvalu. Citizens' homes are often flooded even in large waves, and can be utterly decimated in the worsening storms on the island. Food accessibly is dwindling, as agriculture is becoming increasingly difficult and farmers cannot grow the staple crops on which Tuvulans survive.</p>
			<p>Due to the pressing nature of this crisis, the people of Tuvalu are requesting primarily that measures to reduce emissions are taken. Tuvalu, however, represents a fraction of a percent of global emitters. The countries that tend to emit the most, such as China, The United States, Russia, and India, are largely unaffected by the growing crisis of sea level rise. Alleviating the struggles of the Tuvaluan population is dependent on a global effort to increase awareness and decrease environmental impact.</p>
