			<p>Since Charles Keeling began to study atmospheric carbon at Mauna Loa in the 1950s, there has been significant scientific consensus as to the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As of recent years, consensus in both the scientific and political spheres has been furthered to establish that the accumulation of carbon dioxide is the result of human activity. As  humans continue to produce waste and emit greenhouse gases, they collect in the atmosphere and affect earth's processes.</p>

			<p>A serious issue resulting from the accumulation of CO2 is the rise of sea levels due to heat expansion. Global warming in certain parts of the world's oceans have made the water's average temperature rise. When the water gets warmer, it expands, thus increasing the mass of the ocean. As the sea encroaches on the shore, property is destroyed and soil becomes flooded with salt, making it unproductive for agriculture. These effects are magnified on small islands, and the threat is massive for small islands in the South Pacific such as Tuvalu. Citizens' homes are often flooded even in large waves, and can be utterly decimated in the worsening storms on the island. Food accessibly is dwindling, as agriculture is becoming increasingly difficult and farmers cannot grow the staple crops on which Tuvulans survive.</p>

			<p>Due to the pressing nature of this crisis, the people of Tuvalu are requesting primarily that measures to reduce emissions are taken. Tuvalu, however, represents a fraction of a percent of global emitters. The countries that tend to emit the most, such as China, The United States, Russia, and India, are largely unaffected by the growing crisis of sea level rise. Alleviating the struggles of the Tuvaluan population is dependent on a global effort to increase awareness and decrease environmental impact.</p>

			<p>Tuvalu is a nation in the South Pacific consisting of nine coral reef atolls. Atolls are islands formed through the creation and sinking of volcanic mountains in the ocean, leaving a ring of coral enclosing a lagoon. These coral reefs are composed of limestone structures that provide the perfect host for a large variety of algae that give the reef its color. Additionally, the reef serves an important function for both the marine life that inhabit it, and the people of Tuvalu, who live atop the atolls and use the reef as a source of fish. </p>

			<p>Unfortunately, the fragile atoll ecosystem is facing major threats due to climate change. As the planet gets warmer, more carbon dioxide is dissolved in warm ocean waters, increasing the ocean’s acidity by creating carbonic acid. This acid dissolves the limestone that the atolls are made of, destroying the islands and reef habitats. The increased water temperatures also cause the colorful algae to leave their coral host, a phenomenon known as “coral bleaching”, making it difficult for the coral to find enough food and stay some from disease. </p>

			<p>Additionally, the global temperature increase is causing polar ice caps to melt and water to expand, resulting in sea levels rising. Being only a few meters in height, “the central part of the island, formerly dominated by swampland, is lower than high tide.” (Atoll island vulnerability to flooding and inundation revealed by historical reconstruction: Fongafale Islet, Funafuti Atoll, Tuvalu - Global and Planetary Change, March 2007); making Tuvalu at extreme risk for flooding. Not only are portions of these islands already being covered by water, but an increase in the ferocity of tropical cyclones due to climate change is also causing more extreme flooding in Tuvalu and other surrounding islands. This flooding inundates Tuvalu’s crops, killing off large portions that are necessary for survival.</p>

			<h3>“Only nine small coral atolls barely reach above the water surface. It is the fourth smallest independent nation.”</h3>

			<p>Tuvalu, an independent constitutional monarchy in the southwest Pacific Ocean, comprises nine islands: Nanumea, Niutao, Nanumaga, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae, and Niulakita. There are approximately 12000 citizens, over 6000 inhabitants in Funafuti, the capital of Tuvalu.</p>

			<p>Due to its small size, remoteness, and lack of exploitable resources, most citizens rely on subsistence farming and fishing for economic activities. Communication and transportation are confined: Tuvalu has only one radio station and limited access to electricity and Wifi. Only Funafuti, the capital, has regular telephone services, post offices that can provide connection with outer islands, and paved roads. The major transportation for the inhabitants is bicycle, as the majority cannot afford private cars.</p>
