				<h3>Eco-art Activism</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Art brings people together. Eco-art, especially, highlights questions that concern all humanity. Tuvalu, despite its remote location in relation to most advanced industrialized countries, can make itself more visible through art. As one of the most endangered places due to rising and warming seas, it may not exist as a viable habitat for much longer, and Tuvaluans face the possibility of becoming climate refugees. Artists, historians, environmentalists, social justice advocates, and scientists from around the world are invited to build solidarity by examining implications and exploring solutions. The following events have been organized by Brandeis University</p>

				<h3>"Transcendence in a Secular World: Asian Traditions and a Sustainable Future"</h3>
				<p>A lecture by Historian Prasenjit Duara, 2/3/2017</p>
				<br>
				<p>The crisis of global modernity has been produced by human overreach that was founded upon a paradigm of national modernization. Today, three global changes: the rise of non-western powers, the crisis of environmental sustainability and the loss of authoritative sources of transcendence--the ideals, principles and ethics once found in religions--define our condition. The physical salvation of the world is becoming the transcendent goal of our times, transcending national sovereignty. The foundations of sovereignty can no longer be sought in tunnelled histories of nations; we are recognizing that histories have always been circulatory and the planet is a collective responsibility.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Duara re-considers the values and resources in Asian traditions--particularly of China and India--that Max Weber found wanting in their capacity to achieve modernity. Several traditions in Asia, particularly in local communities offer different ways of understanding the relationship between the personal, ecological and universal. The idea of transcendence in these communities is more dialogical than radical or dualistic: separating God or the human subject from nature. Transnational civil society, NGOS, quasi-governmental and inter-governmental agencies committed to the inviolability or sacrality of the ‘commons’ will need to find common cause with these communities struggling to survive.</p>

				<h3>“Climate Justice in the South Pacific”</h3>
				<p>A lecture by Climate and Social Justice Advocate Salote Soqo (born in Fiji), 2/17/2017
				This presentation introduces the issues surrounding climate justice especially pertaining to the South Pacific. What are the impacts, needs, and strategies in Fiji and other Small Islands Developing States (SIDs)? What can we do as a global community? Calamities such as cyclones and coral bleaching have deeply affected the livelihood of people in places such as Fiji and Tuvalu. Migration is not an easy option culturally and legally. What we need are international commitments to reduce GHG (green house gases) emissions, funds & technical assistance for adaptation, improvement in health care and education systems, and reform in sectoral policies.
